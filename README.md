Simple Game Engine
A basic 3D game engine built using OpenGL for rendering. This engine provides essential features for creating and managing a 3D scene, including:

Rendering: Basic 3D object rendering using OpenGL.
Camera Movement: A controllable camera for navigating the scene.
Lighting: Simple lighting effects for enhanced visual experience.
Physics: Basic physics engine including gravity and object movement.
The engine serves as a foundational project for learning and building on 3D game development concepts like graphics rendering, memory management, and real-time physics.
